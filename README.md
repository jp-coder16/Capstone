🌍 AI-Driven Smart AQI & Hygiene Advisory Platform

An intelligent, AI-powered Air Quality Index (AQI) prediction and hygiene advisory system designed for individuals and institutions.

This platform goes beyond displaying AQI numbers — it delivers actionable intelligence, health risk analysis, workout recommendations, hygiene protocols, explainable AI insights, and institutional decision support.

🎯 Problem Statement

Most AQI dashboards:

Only display AQI values

Provide generic health advice

Do not personalize recommendations

Do not assist institutions in decision-making

Lack explainable AI insights

Are not production-ready with DevOps pipelines

Knowing AQI is not enough.
People need clear decisions and actions.

🚀 Solution Overview

This platform:

Predicts AQI for the next 1–3 days

Classifies health risk (Low / Medium / High)

Recommends workouts (indoor/outdoor)

Suggests hygiene actions (mask type, ventilation, hydration)

Provides dashboards for individuals and institutions

Integrates a chatbot for AQI-related guidance

Uses Explainable AI (SHAP)

Implements DevOps deployment

Secures APIs using cybersecurity best practices
